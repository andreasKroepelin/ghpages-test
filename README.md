# GitHub Pages Example

This repository explores how to use GitHub Pages to create website for a scientific
group.

## How to maintain the website

1. Update the files `_includes/about.md` and `_includes/contact.md` for the
   landing page.
2. Write news in the `_posts` directory following the file format `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`. \
3. Update sites of group members in the `_team` directory.
4. Update sites of lectures in the `_lectures` directory. \
   Set `state: current`, `state: planned`, or `state: old` in the frontmatter
   depending on if the lecture is currently held, planned for the future, or was
   held in the past.
5. Update sites of research projects in the `_projects` directory. \
   Set `state: current` or `state: old` in the frontmatter depending on if the
   project is still active or already completed.
