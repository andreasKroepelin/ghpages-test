  In this group, we are heavily invested with finding new natural numbers.
  Many people deem that to be a completely obsolete discipline but today's
  growth-hungry society demands higher and higher numbers.
  To achieve this goal, we use modern computing technology based on algorithms.
  Just recently, members of our group managed to find a number with more than one
  hundred decimal places!
